      <p class="project-summary-2">“What feature is the most important to you?”</p>
      <img src="images/Chart2.png" class="Chart2" alt="UR_Chart2">
      <br>
      <p class="project text">I did a deep dive to find out the problems people were occurring when using the existing apps in the market. The client expressed the features they wanted to see but didn’t present the current problems. I polled a select group of potential users to understand where the challenges were to successfully create a solution and to determine a direction.</p>
      <h2 class="project-header">30</h2>
      <p class="project-summary-2">“PEOPLE TESTED”</p>
      <h2 class="project-header">55%</h2>
      <p class="project-summary-2">“WERE PROFESSIONALS”</p>
      <h2 class="project-header">98%</h2>
      <p class="project-summary-2">“WERE EXISTING CLOUD STORAGE USERS”</p>
      <h2 class="project-header">92%</h2>
      <p class="project-summary-2">“USED COMPETITOR APPS”</p>
      <p class="project text">PROBLEM - When the client came to us to design a new solution for their app they expressed excitement of opportunities in the young and growing cloud storage and organization market. But not knowing the problems and only knowing the features they wanted to implement, we knew that testing users would help us identify the necessary problems to begin to access the immediate needs to identify the scope of work.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="project text">SOLUTION - With over 30 people combined throughout our testing process, we found the need for an all-in-one inclusive tool that could make working easier. While at least 92% of testers used competitors such as Google Drive and Dropbox, they wanted an affordable, easy-to-use tool where all work could be done in a single space that included storage, sharing, and collaboration.</p>

      <p class="project text">I researched 3 big competitors. The largest and most similar cloud storage competitors Dropbox  and Google G-Suite and the social sharing platform Pinterest.</p>
      <p class="project text">Each of these products/platforms serve a similar purpose yet in their own way. Each platform had different features and served specifc needs for the user. None of the competitors had all the qualities the users we polled were looking for.</p>
      <p class="project text">From our results we were able to create user personas for the ideal users and what their motivation, goals and frustration were.</p>

      <p class="project text">To create user stories, I focused on the different features that would matter the most/least to each user and ranked the importance to focus on the scope of work. Considering the different roles of New User, Returning User, and Administrator, The high’s would allow us to cover the main elements of an all-in-one app from uploading to creating and to sharing. We can then have a list of medium and low tasks for future consideration to improve the app.</p>

      <p class="project text">Testing was a crucial part of the process for the development of this app. From the  conducted a total of three tests. One In-Person test and two others were done remotely. Testers took time to go through a series of requests to get an overall feel of the flow, the results were able to help me improve the functionality of the app. It looked for patterns and how they interacted with the app or what they had difficulty in. There were many questions, some I was able to answer, others were questions of improvement for the next round. Ongoing testing was a necessity to continously improve the app and its features.</p>

      <hr color =#639AAA>
      <p class="project text">The name: After doing several mind-mapping word association exercises and starting with the basics of using the CLOUD/Storage words to brainstorm on the name for the brand - I realized I wanted to play off the ALL-IN-ONE element of the app’s feature.</p>
      <p class="project text">The word HOME and BASE really stuck but I wanted to incorporate the importance this was an ever-growing, ongoing tool in which a business would see continual growth and development. I liked the word “Headquarters” as the home base to a business. Playing off the letter Q in the word Headquarters, I thought a fitting word would be ‘queue’ (representing ongoing and part of the business.)  A fun message and play on words for any start-up.</p>

      <p class="project text">After deciding on the name, I sketched different ideas and played with type and placement. Simple and modern is what we were going for with the focus being on the H and the Q. After many sketches, placing the ‘H’ inside of the circular part of the ‘Q’ seemed to sit well with what I was going for. It had a nice balance.</p>
      <p class="project text">I also incorporated color by using the palette for the project to create touches of color.</p>

The style guide can be helpful for marketing materials, social media, etc.</p>

      <hr color =#639AAA>
      <p class="project text">Remembering the client’s introduction to this project and seeing the project as it is today now gives a solution to problems we didn’t really know existed at first. What worked, in that case, was the testing. The testing was very valuable and getting feedback from the users were helpful in order to see problems and continually improve the design. Because the client hadn’t expressed the problems originally, I was concerned it would end up being another app in the market that wouldn’t solve the needs. Instead, it developed into an app that had value, was resourceful and it made working smarter not harder.</p>
