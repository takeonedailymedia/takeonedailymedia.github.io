      <p>I did a deep dive to find out the problems people were occurring when using the existing apps in the market.
        The client expressed the features they wanted to see but didn’t present the current problems.
        I polled a select group of potential users to understand where the challenges were to successfully
        create a solution and to determine a direction.</p>
      <p class="Question1">“What is something you'd like to see differently from other
        storage and productivity tools already out on the market”</p>

      <h1>Problem</h1>
      <p>When the client came to us to design a new solution for their app they expressed excitement
        of opportunities in the young and growing cloud storage and organization market.
        But not knowing the problems and only knowing the features they wanted to implement, we knew
        that testing users would help us identify the necessary problems to begin to access the immediate needs
        to identify the scope of work.</p>
      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <p> With over 30 people combined throughout our testing process, we found the need for an
        all-in-one inclusive tool that could make working easier. While at least 92% of testers used competitors
        such as Google Drive and Dropbox, they wanted an affordable, easy-to-use tool where all work could be done
        in a single space that included storage, sharing, and collaboration.</p>

      <p>We researched 3 big competitors. The largest and most similar cloud storage competitors
        Dropbox and Google G-Suite and the social sharing platform Pinterest.</p>

      <p>Each of these products/platforms serve a similar purpose yet in their own way.
        Each platform had different features and served specifc needs for the user.
        None of the competitors had all the qualities the users we polled were looking for.</p>

      <p>From our results we were able to create user personas for the ideal users and what
        their motivation, goals and frustration were.</p>

        Testers took time to go through a series of requests to get an overall feel of the flow, the

        how they interacted with the app or what they had difficulty in. There were many questions, some
        I was able to answer, others were questions of improvement for the next round. Ongoing testing was
        a necessity to continously improve the app and its features.</p>

        and starting with the basics of using the CLOUD/Storage words to brainstorm on the name for
        the brand - I realized I wanted to play off the ALL-IN-ONE element of the app’s feature.</p>
      <p>The word HOME and BASE really stuck but I wanted to incorporate the importance this was an
         ever-growing, ongoing tool in which a business would see continual growth and development.
         I liked the word “Headquarters” as the home base to a business. Playing off the letter 'Q'
         in the word Headquarters, I thought a fitting word would be ‘queue’ (representing ongoing
         and part of the business.)  A fun message and play on words for any start-up.</p>

        many sketches, placing the ‘H’ inside of the circular part of the ‘Q’ seemed to sit well

      <p class="project text">Remembering the client’s introduction to this project and seeing the project as it is today now gives a solution to problems we didn’t really know existed at first. What worked, in that case, was the testing. The testing was very valuable and getting feedback from the users were helpful in order to see problems and continually improve the design. Because the client hadn’t expressed the problems originally, I was concerned it would end up being another app in the market that wouldn’t solve the needs. Instead, it developed into an app that had value, was resourceful and it made working smarter not harder.</p>
