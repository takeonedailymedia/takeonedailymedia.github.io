        <h1>When I started my first lemonade stand</h1>
        <p>at 7 who knew I was forming a start-up. It started with
          cardboard scraps, a sharpie and a gallon of lemonade from
          the refrigerator. I became a neighborhood hit, but most
          importantly my lemonade stand helped me discover a few things
          about myself that would carry me throughout life (on repeat)
          that I pass on through my work.</p>

    <h4>I like to build things:</h4>
    <p>Learning was always a building block for me. I wanted to learn
      everything and anything.  I enjoyed lego always as a kid, I hated
      dolls. Maybe I was destined to be an architect. I enjoyed all
      forms of art and surprised myself when I enrolled in business school.
      Maybe I could build an empire and become a CEO of some large
      corporation.</p>

    <h4>I surround myself around people that I could learn from:</h4>
    <p>Business school gave me a foundation, but my first “real” job is
      what set the tone. Right after graduate school, I landed a job as
      a coordinator for a television production company and I had the
      opportunity to travel cross-country with the film crew and learn
      about production. My U.S. journey then led me to Europe and Asia
      journeys. I met people from far away lands, was introduced to many
      cultures and learned the true meaning of “story”.</p>

    <p>The people we filmed made me appreciate a true character, but
      although that was fiction, it opened my eyes to things I had
      never seen before. For 6 years, I traveled to as many places as
      I could, said “yes” to every new film opportunity that came my way,
      worked long hours and gave 200% to learning the in’s and out’s
      of production to eventually become a line producer. </p>

      <h4>I like a challenge:</h4>
      <p>Life’s unexpected twists happen and for me, it was a new family.
        This one wasn’t planned, but it was my blessing in disguise.
        After living out of my suitcase and racking up frequent flyer
        points from the production life, the opposite had hit when my
        daughter was born. Being a mom was hard. Being a single mom was
        even harder. </p>

      <p>This little person was teaching me so much about life that
        I would never have expected. All those things that my parents
        said to me as a kid that I never understood suddenly became
        clear. I wanted my daughter to grow up in a safe world, have
        a voice and be the best version of herself she possibly could
        be. I knew traveling and going back to production life wasn’t
        an option for me anymore. I was now responsible for someone
        else’s life. </p>

      <p>Enter the 2nd career at a design agency as their Marketing
        and Communications Director.  As I told the journey of their
        story through the social media rise and watched technology
        expand and take over, it was exciting. But in recent years,
        I also saw the bad in how it was being used; Online bullying,
        violence, and a curated life that made others feel they were
        never good enough leading to self-doubt.</p>

      <p>What kind of world would my daughter grow up in? Will she
        remember to have that human connection and experience things
        without a screen as I did growing into a young adult? Will
        she want to put her phone down and go outside and explore life?</p>

      <h4>I like to build things:</h4>
      <p>The technology isn’t going away anytime soon, so instead of
        pushing it aside, I want to design a better future. One that
        integrates both digital and real-life experiential moments to
        create those human connections through emotion. I want to evoke
        kindness back into the world and especially for the young adults
        out there. I refuse to believe that boundaries exist between
        disciplines and that there is still so much building to do.</p>

      <p>Let’s tell better stories!</p>
